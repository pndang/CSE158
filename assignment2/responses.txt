{'218022490': [(5, 'You have a sufficient answer. I recommend numbering the figures so you don\'t have to use "left", "right", or "other" too much just to navigate your viewers to the figures; this can reduce redundant verbiage in your text. You should also label your plots and consider how viewers may feel looking at your plots. For example, the x-axis text of your left plot are really hard to read. Other than that, nice sufficient answer.'), (5, 'I liked your choice for a linear regression model and one-hot encoding does seem to best fit your feature types as well. I forgot but is the ratings variable discrete? If so, classification would work. Though your choice for linear regression + MSE is already great. Good job on this part!'), (6, '+1 bonus point for accounting for multicollinearity. I liked the justifications you used for linear regression, though I think there many ways to make this workable for a classification task. Nice consideration for multicollinearity among the variables that may seem correlated with ratings as well. In future projects, I think incorporating a couple visuals showing some of these correlations would make your work much more compelling.'), (7, "+2 bonus points for in-depth and breadth-ful literature review. Although I liked your lit review a lot, it makes your paper comes across as severely off-proportioned (section lengths-wise) and that there are many room for improvements that you researched but didn't implement for your model. Great job reconnecting back to your model on why certain things aren't applicable though."), (4, '-1 point for a lack of (1) alternative models and (2) parameter interpretations. I personally wouldn\'t mention "causality" too much considering the scope of your project because of how big of a topic jump that is. I recommend interpreting your parameters, which can be as simple as spotting and identifying the most influential (or least) params and their associated features. This will not only help broaden your analysis but also help you understand your model better. This is especially doable with models similar to yours, linear regression.')], '217709846': [(6, '+1 bonus point for highly-detailed introduction to Steam. Nice introduction to your project, I am sure some readers would appreciate your description of Steam\'s history. Great clarifications on how you made the positive and negative data samples. I find your ratio of train/valid/test split pretty interesting, I guess that could work with such a large number of data points. The only recommendation I have is too include more informative and "fun" visualizations instead of a python list of lists.'), (4, "-1 point for insufficient model comparisons, you sort of did, but lack strengths and weaknesses for each model relative to one another. Overall, solid analysis and assessment of your model's objective value per iteration, though I think line graphs would look much more appealing than boxes of numbers/text. Great job overall though."), (5, 'Since you sort of combined section 2 and 3, my feedback here will be the same as above. One final recommendation I have in this section is to have all of your accuracies for each model in one table for easier comparison by the readers.'), (7, '+2 bonus points for a detailed literature review. I really enjoyed reading your literature review; however, for each paper, I recommend briefly describing the gist behind each model used (or only describe the best model), rather than listing them side-by-side (sometimes this looks like a letter dump).'), (5, 'Your answer is sufficient. Please also ignore my recommendation regarding an accuracy table in section 3 as you did that here. Good work overall, I enjoyed reading your paper.')], '218001062': [(5, 'Good statistical and visual analysis overall. I recommend emphasizing the "meaning" of your statistical observations, rather than listing the numbers or positions of the plot components because the readers can see these for themselves, or a combination of both. For example, I think lines like "Figure 1.52 shows that the higher the payment, the more polarized the stars of the item tend to be" is beautiful, it directly shows the meaning of what is seen.'), (5, "Nice explanations for why you used MSE, though was it necessary to include the MAE equation since you are not going to use it? Nice consideration of generalizability (or applicability) as well. Good logic towards the end too where you considered the variables' availability and chronological order in actual practice."), (6, '+1 bonus point for comprehensiveness. Great and concise model descriptions for this section! I really liked Figure 3.31 that provided a brief description for each model provided by Surprise, this allwos people who are new to the Surprise library understand these models. I liked the diversity in model types as well, great breadth and depth of analysis here.'), (5, 'Good literature review, it reminded me of one of the last lectures. Nice coverage of the papers and the gist of their ideas, I find your summaries easy to read and they also provide a comparative picture between the models well.'), (5, 'Nice and long closing; it allows a reader to get a general grasp of your paper without reading any other section. I liked your connection to real-world applications towards the end as well to better connect customers and items.')], '218052927': [(5, 'Nice and sufficient introduction; I would appreciate a little more exploratory analysis and statistical properties descriptions though. Good abstract as well. I am curious that if the amount of zero helpfulness was to the point of inability for removal, how bad was your data imbalance problem?'), (5, 'FYI, I stopped before section 3 for the second section of the assignment write up. You have good model descriptions and evaluations. I recommend having one uniform language and tone throughout your paper will help by not giving readers a language-shock. I loved how you included "if you\'re following along". Also, 8 x 10^-5 is a really small number to talk about correlations in the context as you did.'), (5, "Nice visualizations and tables showing your models' performance. I feel bad for your experiments section as it deserves a similar length as other sections :("), (5, 'Solid literature review, you presented a wide variety of modeling methods and features choices that are available for the task.'), (5, "Good conclusion. I liked how you connected your paper's findings to real-world applications of your use case. Nice job.")]}
